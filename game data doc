Here's a list of the warfare system components in the  gamedata codebase that you can nullify disable or modify for any porpuse.

warfare.script
warfare_factions.script
warfare_levels.script
warfare_options.script
smart_terrain_warfare.script
sim_squad_warfare.script
pda_warfare.script
ui_warfare.script
ui_warfare_tab.script
ui_warfare_menu.script
warfare_faction_control.script
warfare_ai.script
warfare_tasks.script
warfare_heli.script
warfare_game_state.script

  
To disable these, you can rename or remove these files, or modify their contents to return immediately without executing any warfare-related code. Additionally, you'll want to check and possibly modify:

_g.script (for any warfare-related global variables or functions)
sim_board.script (for warfare-related simulation board modifications)
game_relations.script (for warfare-specific faction relations)
Disabling these components will effectively shut down the vanilla warfare system, allowing you to implement a new standalone mod without conflicts.
